#include <iostream>


Working with Expressions, Statements, and Operators

If you need to spread a statement over two lines
you can do it by inserting a backslash (\) at the end.

cout << "Hello \
	 World" << endl; // split to two lines is OK
or

cout << "Hello "
	"World" << endl; // two string literals is OK


Block : a group of Statements

r - values : values to the right of equal sign ; content of memory location
l - values : values to the left of equal sign ; locations in memory
